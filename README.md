# USGS EarthquakeMapping

## Backgound 

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from USGS data set based on their longitude and latitude.

## Technologies 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Leaflet.js

## Data

[USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

## Visualization 

* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
* Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Created a legend that will provide context for map data.
